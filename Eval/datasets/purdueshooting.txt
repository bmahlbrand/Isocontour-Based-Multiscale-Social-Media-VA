According to the police scanner, they're still searching for people. I reiterate: resume normal operations my arse.
Looks like police are allowing students to walk around outside again. Still manning their posts @jconline
At some point we need to look at the parents for these kids who feel the need to kill innocent.
#Purdue shooting. Mitch Daniels , please give us an update !

I REFUSE to go to the rest of my classes the same afternoon as a shooting. I won't go.
Shelter in place at State and Pierce. #Purdue
@Kaebenut I think one person shot, and they have a suspect in custody

So happy to hear that all #Students #Staff #Police and #firefighters are Sade at #Purdue
Lol I don't get the point in someone bringing a fun to a campus and shooting people..
@Kurt_miller1 No. Don't take someone's death and a tragic accident as an excuse to talk about providing more people with more guns.
So happy to hear that all #students #staff and #police are safe in #Purdue
HEY @LifeAtPurdue  SOMEBODY FUCKING GOT SHOT ON CAMPUS. THE STUDENT BODY IS TRAUMATIZED. HOW CAN YOU JUSTIFY RESUMING "NORMAL OPERATIONS?"
Week 1: drama. Week 2: shooting. Can I be done with school? Please
But you actually kinda killed any trust I had in anyone.
@ja_lyn lol there was one shooter and I have heard that one person died but they haven't released that yet on the news.

And why dont we have stricter gun control again? Doesnt hurt till it hits you at home you fucking idiots.
I will not 'resume normal operations' until I feel safe. A student was just shot in class for God's sake!
I hate thinking too much!!! *emoji of a girl ripping her hair out" Lol
I hate thinking too much!!!!! *emoji of a girl ripping her hair out* Lol
You never think about the effects of a school shooting but then it happens in a city or school near you and you don't really know what to do
Latest I have on #purdueshooting is that one TA was killed and several other shot by 2 shooters. Both in custody. #BreakingNews #RT
@N_Vincent13 @DodgeDalton EXACTLY. And just look into the chemical balances of mass murders in the past. They're wacked.
@Kurt_miller1 yea the person was sick. But him having the right to carry a gun sure helped him accomplish what he wanted wouldn't you say?
@Ddog_94 there was a shooting
Why is CNN reporting no one was shot??

@indystar - whoops - check your headline spelling on Purdue shooting - it's custody - not custoday...

Shooting at Purdue University in Indiana.
My prayers are with Purdue students,  staff, & families as they deal with today's shooting.
One day I hope his ex comes into my job & approaches me. Lmfaoo i. Will. Die. Laughing.
"@BellsMercado: 5 people got shot, and I still have to go to class. Cool." Exactly.
Classes aren't cancelled....cause it's totally normal to have a school shooting and then continue on with our lives like nothing happened...
Another good example of why we shouldn't have guns.
This shooting at Purdue is making me so nervous. It could happen to anyone. So scary.
Basically killed my first speech.
Went to sleep hoping the snow would cancel my classes..honestly would rather have had all my classes than had a fellow boiler get shot #BTFU
It really kills me inside knowing I live in a world where people think a gun and shooting others will solve their problems.

I was in a good mood, until my teacher compared graduation to someone dying. Yep. Shit just got real. 😳💀🙈🙉🙊 #analogies #ohdonna
@DodgeDalton @N_Vincent13 agreed 100%. And if it is a reaction, no one wakes up and says I'm gonna kill a school if they're not Ill.
@N_Vincent13 MASS MURDER. Dude you're literally to fried from the booki to even argue with.
@2thor3 yeah I believe there are 3 suspects, maybe just 2, but people are injured and I had a few friends inform about a fatality.
I'm sorry, @LifeAtPurdue but if you think I'm "resuming my normal schedule" after a school shooting, you're insane.

RIP to the one fatality #PrayersForPurdue
I would be in algebra right now, probably wanting to kill myself
sad to hear of a shooting on campus. You grow numb to these reports until it hits close to home & close to your heart. #PurdueShooting
@ValerieHeruska @StarkAnneR @seanmeddington @melpels @reyjunco @c_w_reynolds all safe and sheltered. Lock down lifted.
#pupd.chief john cox confirms 1 suspect. 1 dead.
No ID on #purdueshooting vic. Suspect not cooperating.
1 killed and 5 injured in shootings at Purdue today. Never take for granted the fact that you are ALIVE. LIVE EACH DAY TO THE FULLEST
Someone has lost their life in a campus shooting, and I'm here in class. Where everyone is acting like nothing is wrong. This isn't okay.
@JusticeFycn @Its_Contavious hahahaha at the rate we drink we might just die haha
"Approximately 25 officers on scene between 1-2min" -Purdue Police Chief. Now that's a fast respond time!
My thoughts and prayers are with the family of the one person killed today at Purdue
Everybody so hype to get to college for a new life. They still shooting out there too
Of course my dad would call the police chief here.
There is no reason classes should resume. Someone just died. We may be safe, but a tragedy just occurred at our school.
Prayers to the victim of the Purdue shooting and prayers to all others involved. #evergreatfulevertrue
“@purdueexponent: Purdue confirmed one person has died from the shooting. @purdueexponent” Plain ridiculous. 😔
somebody ended up dying in the Purdue shooting , crazy .
Thank god for this steroid shot. Not only do I feel better it gives me energy to study like a boss. #i♥steroids
These valentine card tweets kill me 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
I'm only being a bitch because my sister could've been shot and you have no connection or reason to say that I don't have that right.
Shooting on Purdue's campus. I do not feel safe going to class regardless of what is said by our school officials.
Idk about you guys ... But if there was even a 1% chance I might get shot on the way to class .. I just wouldn't go.
This isn't a typical campus shooting. Oh I'm sorry, I was unaware one type of shooting is more threatening than another.
Purdue Police confirm one deceased, one suspect in custody. I never imagined something like this happening here. My thoughts and prayers. 🙏
@chris_como movie theater shooting?!
@BenAEllam I get killed every 10 seconds and I can't camp 😭😭
59 days until spring. :/ not as happy now that I'm watching the pursue shooting stuff on tv
Can't believe what went down on our own campus today. Praying for all those affected by the shooting.
If you truly think that gun control wouldn't prevent incidents like this you're ignorant.
“@stljv: Widener University Student Shot on Campus http://t.co/DOMoKyK0L9 via @nbcphiladelphia”
“@justinlmack: Suspect entered the bldg, shot the victim, and left. Did not attempt to target others”
@AllisonStrickle k heard there was a shooting
Purdue sucks for not canceling the rest of the classes for the day after a TA has been shot.
@_YourMajesty look look at my screen shot lol you agreed you can't take it back after you lose and get in debt don't be on the bs lol
Remember everybody. Just because we had ANOTHER school shooting, it's not time to talk about gun control. #Purdue
Tired of all these school shootings ...... Now you know why we don't like to go to school .........
The news keeps saying "it sounds like" "we think that" "police feel like".Stay inside. Stay safe. Stay with people you know. #prayforpurdue
@CourtneyT_94 a ta got shot and he/she died.. It was a murder in a class!
@_YourMajesty I got the screen shot and posted it you seen you agreed you owe me 5 boy don't be a fleece lol
During a shooting on campus, classroom doors don't lock and classes resume immediately after, for once I'm disappointed at my @LifeAtPurdue
@DDT43 yea a TA died though the shit was damn near bout a grade
@cougar_slayer81 we just need another weapon through the air to take pressure off I praise him so much because he did what he did on his own
Now isn't the time for gun control arguments. Show some respect for the victim and his family.
when kay holla she tried to run from the police 😂😂 i was weak! bitch this big tryna escape and shit!
@_YourMajesty brush I pit the screen shot on  here you agreed to playing 5 for the first game and 10 for the second I owed you 10 and won 15

@_YourMajesty na I ain't playing you for bred no more your a fleece lol !! And you lying with the screen shot on twitter smh lmao
The problem is not guns, Israel is evidence of that. There is a problem with society when shootings have become a regular occurrence.
never thought i'd be at a school with a shooting.
My heart is aching for the TA who was killed, the class, and others involved in this shooting. Can't believe this happened at my school...
We need stricter gun laws NOW.
I just wanna know why a campus would tell students to "go about your normal day" after there's been a shooting
Another day, another shooting. This is pathetic America. We should be ashamed. This is a disgraceful state of affairs.
Just would like to know why I make some people so unhappy. If anyone would like to tell me. Take a shot at me. I wanna know.
Now every dumbass and their brother are gonna be all over the news about gun control
I may hate PU but never want a nut job to kill innocent people. Good job to the police and hope the campus can go back to normal now.

UPDATE @WTHRcom: Law enforcement says suspect "entered the facility, took the actions that he took" and left the building. #purdueshooting
@QueenHerc thanks for the concern. I'm ok one person died and it was a murder in class and we are in lock down
Literally the only updates purdue gave us today were "someone got shot in EE" and  45 minutes later "resume all normal activity" #what
@smileyface2002 Have u heard any new news about the Purdue shooting?
@21_2x thanks Robert. I'm good one person got murdered and we are on lockdown
These pictures of the Purdue shooting are making me sick to my stomach. You gotta be some sick minded individuals to wanna kill people..
If the media would stop giving all these school shootings so much attention, they would eventually stop
We are told to go back to normal ops, but I don't know how when the shooting occurred 2 buildings from my office. #Purdue #sick
@fanookhoy yea I'm good... one person was murdered
I see pictures of two different men w/guns, yet one of the guys who was on the ground had a completely different outfit. I'm staying inside
So just one died

Rip for the guy who lost his life at Purdue
If colleges would allow people to carry handguns then that shooting could have been prevented.
Police will be searching the suspects house soon
Sad situation at Purdue. Crazy to think anyone would let their life get so messed up that they would have too kill someone.
I'm still in shock over this Purdue shooting, probably because it hits close to home
“@wylie_gorup: my friend from ireland just fb messaged me saying he heard about the Purdue shooting.  this is international news.”

@BsuObserver @BSUKeepitClassy people who want stricter gun regulation.

Claiming first about a news story where someone died is not professional. Plain and simple.

“@GuardianUS: 21-year-old #Purdue University shooting victim remembered as 'phenomenal' student http://t.co/BQsJRrDAQ3" Where's Cody's fmly?
if I dont answer next bell its bc my phone died
Campus shooting 2 days in a row. Aka suicide shooters smh
damn there was another college shooting. purdue yesterday now oklahoma today wth man
@JennyJohnsonHi5 when my parents died, people “liked” it. Caused a stir, but I understood they didn’t actually LIKE that they died.
Apparently the hot new thing to do is shoot up a school.
ombers strap bombs to their chest stand in a crowd of people. Shooters in the US try and kill people before themselves.
What is going on with this world? Another campus shooting in two days?! Pray for Purdue and Oklahoma. #EndTheMadness
Another day another school shooting...wtf
stay safe, #Sooners. (these school shootings getting out of hand)
What's with all these school shootings??!!??
I go to BSU so y'all know why I was dying laughing in my last tweet.
Shooting at Purdue yesterday and Univ of Oklahoma today. I should be able to feel safe at my school and not worry about shootings.
"@apneal: Also, heart is breaking with the news of another shooting on a college campus. Thinking of Oklahoma"
Shooting reported on University of Oklahoma campus... This is just awful http://t.co/TP5I1AQT9n

Another shooting on a college campus today😒 pray for everyone involved.
Another college shooting...prayers to U of Oklahoma.
@judithann313 more die each day we dont start the process of winning. There are lives that could be saved that aren't b/c of all or nothing
Just heard on the news there was another school shooting at University of Oklahoma.... What is happening 😰
Sad to say but I think they should allow teachers the option to conceal carry a weapon nowadays
serious note though, this is the 4th shooting in two weeks. what is going on?
2 college shootings in 2 days?! What in the actual fuck, America?! http://t.co/mVtm1vQz8J
Wow another shooting at OU.
What happens when one day we all die, and find out that everything we were told to obey as humans was all just made up.
Seriously another campus shooting in the states?
Wtf is happening. Three shootings in less than a month of the new year. Thoughts and prayers. http://t.co/pLYGY6KDqR
Sad to report on the 2nd day of a shooting incident on a college campus. Yesterday #Purdue today #Oklahoma  Unclear on injures today #sad
Another shooting? My God.
daily now?“@ABC: DEVELOPING: Univ. of Okla issues immediate shelter in place order after reports of shots fired on campus; police on scene.”
@judithann313 is it better to save 1 of 45 million or continue to wait till we can get a law for all 45 and let another 45 die
Another shooting at Univ. Oklahoma merely 24hrs after shooting here and people still want to try and argue gun control? Think beyond
😭 “@evanrachelwood: There have been 3 school shootings in america in the past 48 hours. . Just FYI.”
Guns aren't to blame. It's the idiots that have them. If the faculty takes a stand at these schools, I am will to bet the shootings stop.

There's gotta be a way, 'cause going on without you is killing me everyday.
@VanwykWTHR  daily now?“Univ. of Oklahoma issues immediate shelter in place order after reports of shots fired on campus; police on scene.”
My faith is just getting weak, hope died a long time ago.
Seriously. I'm heartbroken and exhausted of all of these shootings. How many more is it going to take before something is done?
And another shooting today! University of Oklahoma.. These are the idiots that make the public want gun control.. Smh. No injuries at least.
Another school shooting. Seriously what goes through people's minds?
Why.. “@ABC: DEVELOPING: Univ. of Oklahoma issues immediate shelter in place order after reports of shots fired on campus; police on scene.”
“@Dat_Lantis: shooting at OU right now, in shelter.” this can't be happening. please stay safe.
“@balberts23: Another shooting at University of Oklahoma??? Come on people.”
Another shooting?
2 things..  1)WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH PEOPLE AND THESE COLLEGE SHOOTINGS. 2)WHY THE FUCK DOES BALL STATE HAVE SATURDAY CLASSES
If guns are to blame I'm guilty because I'm an owner. They will never be off the streets so taking them away from good people is ridiculous.
First Purdue and now the university of Oklahoma? Pray for those who have been affected by these shootings
DIE OUT AND SAVE YOURSELF!
Shooting at Oklahoman.... Why am I sitting on campus.
@lincord88 @ArtByAlida @lincord88 @ArtByAlida I don't know. This is just crazy. We're still trying to figure out why Cody shot Andrew.
We just have to stand and fight as a whole against the idiots who have them. One by one it will stop the school shootings, at least.
Look... Another school shooting.
Another college shooting.. This time at the University of Oklahoma. What the hell is wrong with people??  #OklahomaUniversity

First, a shooting at Widener Univ. Monday, then a shooting here yesterday, and now a shooting scare at Oklahoma Univ. #AbsolutelyRidiculous
When will people learn guns aren't the issue. People are the issue. Can't disarm the law abiding people because of a select few.
I could kill someone today. 😒
A gun is just a tool. Same as a wrench. Both can kill in the right hands.
@KaitlinBanx they have murdered people in cold blood. Why should I not be considered better than a murderer?

@KaitlinBanx no self defense isn't murder, same as soldiers or police officers killing. Those are usually justified. Cold blood murder isn't
Many people die with their music still in them. To often because they are always getting ready to live. Before they know it, time runs out..

@judithann313 1% of abortions are due to rape. Would you rather save 44.55 million or kill 45 million?
@SamiJune14 you done dying? Lol

@TheMUFCVoice it was exasperation...especially after the past couple weeks. We showed the "never say die" and that's what is important
It ain't the whiskey that's killing me.❤️
@judithann313 all or nothing mentality is letting 99% die everyday. Hands are not clean when you could make a difference today

I'm grateful for friends like @Leele3nic0le and @nicoleeh, who scrape my car off for me so I don't die <3
@judithann313 and the all or nothing mentality.  It is allowing 99% to die on the point of principal only.
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger ♥

Isn't it ironic how stones taught you to fly, love taught you to lie, and living taught you to die?
R.I.P grandpa. Free Unk. Nuf said 👌❤️
@judithann313 my thought is less killing is good. We can do that today and then fight for the final bit then.
