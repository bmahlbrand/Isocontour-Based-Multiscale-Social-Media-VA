Issues during coding:

1) Why mouseout does not work on both cluster node and boundary?
Ans: When the user hover on the feature, which triggered the mouseover, the canvas redraw the the previous features go away.
    Thus when hover out, the system cannot find the previous corresponding object.
	
2) need a way to simplify the curves before sampling points.
